\chapter{Conclusions}

In this project we studied C3AE, a compact model for age estimation.
We constructed the model according to the indications of \cite{c3ae},
presented its main characteristics and experimented
with it on a number of datasets and in different conditions.

Our best result of 8.64 MAE on the test set is roughly in line with the paper's
6.44, but unfortunately the results are not directly comparable because
we used different datasets due to Morph not being open and we trained for
less epochs due to limited hardware availability.

Our own ablation study confirmed the importance of the context and
cascade modules, as the original authors wrote as well,
and of the augmentation as well.

In future works and with better hardware availability, we would hope
to test this model on larger datasets like the full IMDB-WIKI and
for longer training times. Furthermore, in our opinion evaluating the
performance of an ensemble of these models is another interesting possibility.
